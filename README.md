# Shell.ai Hackathon : Wind-Farm-Layout-Optimiztion

Particle Swarm Optimization is a meta heuristic optimization algorithm inspired from natural obeservations like flocks of birds. In this algorithm each particle is randomly
generated in the solution space.
To run :

```
 py main.py --t [no of turbines] --p [no of particles] --i [no of iterations]
```
